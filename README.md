My Advent of Code 2022 project will be in C#, since
I have some volunteer work coming up that's going to involve .NET
integration and I might as well take this opportunity to learn
a little bit about it.

The code that's committed here is going to be very naive, but hopefully
I'll get to learn a thing or two as I go.
